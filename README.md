How to implement:
1.	Copy and paste whole .ZIP file into your public_html directory in your webserver.
2.	Open settings.php in edit mode and set each feild as you wish. Then save it. Do not navigate to the panel via a web browser until this document is filled out.
3.	Navigate to {your website hostname}/admin/mysql.php - It will run and create the datatables.
4.	Then open {your website hostname}/admin/ and fix any errors. If there are none you can go and delete the MySQL.php file.
